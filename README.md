Handwritten Text Converter

This project is a web-based application that converts handwritten text from images into editable plain text, attempting to preserve the original line breaks and paragraph formatting. It leverages the power of the Google Cloud Vision API for Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
‚ú® Features

    Image Upload: Easily upload handwritten image files (PNG, JPG, etc.).

    Live Text Overlay: See the recognized text overlaid directly on your uploaded image, visually matching the original layout.

    Intelligent Line & Paragraph Detection: Utilizes advanced logic based on word bounding boxes to accurately reconstruct line breaks and paragraph spacing, mimicking your original notes.

    Smart Punctuation Handling: Ensures conventional spacing around punctuation marks (e.g., no space before periods, commas).

    Plain Text Preview: Review the extracted and formatted plain text directly in the browser before downloading.

    Text Download: Download the converted text as a .txt file, ready for use in any text editor.

    Responsive Design: A clean and responsive user interface built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring usability across different devices.

üîë How to Get a Google Cloud Vision API Key

To use this application, you need an API key from Google Cloud Platform with the Cloud Vision API enabled.

    Go to Google Cloud Console: Navigate to the Google Cloud Console.

    Create a New Project (or select an existing one):

        Click on the project selector dropdown at the top.

        Click "New Project" and follow the prompts to create a new project.

        If you have an existing project, select it.

    Enable the Cloud Vision API:

        In the Google Cloud Console, use the navigation menu (‚ò∞) on the left.

        Go to APIs & Services > Library.

        Search for "Cloud Vision API" and select it.

        Click the "Enable" button.

    Create API Credentials:

        In the Google Cloud Console, go to APIs & Services > Credentials.

        Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" at the top and select "API key".

        Your API key will be generated. Copy this key.

        Important: For client-side applications like this one, it's highly recommended to restrict your API key to prevent unauthorized use.

            Click "RESTRICT KEY" on the API key details page.

            Under "Application restrictions," select "HTTP referrers (web sites)" and add your domain(s) (e.g., http://localhost:8000/* for local testing, or your deployed website's URL).

            Under "API restrictions," select "Restrict key" and choose "Cloud Vision API" from the dropdown.

            Click "Save".
